      <description>This software is built with Go programming language. It means you will get an executable binary to run on your machine. You don&amp;rsquo;t need extra software like MAMP, XAMPP, or WAMP to run Tania, but you may need MySQL database if you choose to use it instead of SQLite (the default database.)
The easiest way to install Tania is using pre-built binaries for Windows (x64) and Linux (x64). You can download it from the release page.</description>
