      <title>What We Got Right When We Built Tania</title>

      <description>Hi, my name is Didiet, one of the co-founders of Tanibox. Two years ago in 2017, Asep, my co-founder told me that he wanted to rewrite the software that he has been built to better architecture. He felt that the three-tier architecture built on top of PHP and Symfony is not flexible enough to meet our business need. We rewrote Tania with embracing uncertainty in mind and I think there are things we got right when building Tania.</description>

      <description>You probably have heard the term precision farming or precision agriculture almost from everywhere. But how much do you understand it? Precision farming is a booming sector, involves various equipment and lengthy knowledge and resources to work. And some farmers can be a bit confused. Do you feel the same way too? Let&amp;rsquo;s break it down.
What is Precision Farming? It&amp;rsquo;s definitely more than just using a farm management system and do your daily work at your farm&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Do you know that 37% of Earth&amp;rsquo;s land is used for agricultural purposes? 11% is used for growing crops, and the rest is for pastures. One of the most overlooked challenges in agriculture is maintaining and improving efficiency. With climate changes already happen everywhere, humanity will have to face and tackle these challenges. Why? As the population only continues to grow, much of the world will depend on more effective agriculture practices to produce more outputs the world population relies on.</description>

      <title>The New Direction of Tania Project: What We&#39;re Going to Develop on Tania</title>

In the last few weeks, there&amp;rsquo;s a discussion between initiators of this project about the direction of Tania. We all agree that Tania should be more involving the community in the agriculture ecosystem around the world to promote precision agriculture practice. Because we believe precision agriculture can make farming more sustainable ecologically and economically. The world is too big for us to do it alone.</description>

      <title>Smart Farming; Steps to Do and Common Questions Around That</title>

      <description>Smart farming is an idea to cultivate crops with a combination of the latest technology and data analysis. The objective of it is to get more yields with few bad impacts on the environment than the conventional farming method.
How can we start doing smart farming? Is it expensive? These are common questions. We can start small without buying expensive equipment.
The first step is collecting data. We can start to gather data by using a simple tool like a spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.</description>

      <description>This software is built with Go programming language. It means you will get an executable binary to run on your machine. You don&amp;rsquo;t need extra software like MAMP, XAMPP, or WAMP to run Tania, but you may need MySQL database if you choose to use it instead of SQLite (the default database.)
The easiest way to install Tania is using pre-built binaries for Windows (x64) and Linux (x64). You can download it from the release page.</description>

      <description>Tania current stable version is 1.5.1 was released in 2018. It is a total rewrite of the initial Tania that is written in PHP (Symfony framework). Version 1.5.1 uses Go lang and we will use it for the later version. We change the language because we want to make Tania easy to install in any machine&amp;ndash;on the cloud environment, on the NAS (Network Attached Storage), or even on the small device like Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>The overall architecture of Tania is built so it doesn’t rely on particular storage, protocol, or serialization format. Because it needs to be deployed to a different environment like Raspberry Pi, NAS QNAP, or the cloud like AWS. We name the Tania architecture as Modular Monolith as each domain share nothing.
